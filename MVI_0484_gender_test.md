**Frames:** 3
**Test Focus:** Visual gender identification only

## Results

**PRIMARY GENDER ASSESSMENT**: 
This appears to be a male person.

**VISUAL EVIDENCE**:
The individual in the frames has short to medium-length dark hair that falls around their face in loose waves. Their facial features include a relatively straight nose and somewhat angular jawline, which are typically associated with masculine characteristics. The person is wearing a black, long-sleeved shirt that is loose-fitting, making it difficult to discern their body structure clearly. However, the overall appearance, including the facial structure and hair style, suggests a male identity. The presence of a small lavalier microphone clipped to their shirt indicates they are likely participating in a video recording or audition, which is consistent with the context of assessing their gender for casting purposes.

**CONFIDENCE LEVEL**:
High. The assessment is based on clear visual cues such as facial structure and hair style, which are commonly used indicators of gender. The consistency across all three frames reinforces this assessment.

**CASTING NOTES**:
This person could be described as a young adult male with dark, curly or wavy hair and a neutral expression. He appears to be of Asian descent based on his facial features. For casting purposes, he might be suitable for roles requiring a youthful, somewhat androgynous or neutral appearance. His versatility in expression (as hinted at by the slight variations in his facial expression across the three frames) could make him suitable for a variety of character types.
