## ACOUSTIC & VOCAL ANALYSIS
- Emotional tone: Intense, commanding, with urgency and frustration
- Speaking style: Forceful and theatrical delivery
- Number of speakers: Single speaker throughout
- Vocal dynamics: Rapid pace, high volume, dramatic emphasis
- Audio quality: Clear studio recording, minimal background noise
- Background/environment: Controlled studio acoustics"""

Based on the facial features, hair, and overall appearance, the person appears to be male. The assessment is made considering the following:
- Facial structure: The jawline and facial contours appear masculine.
- Hair: The person has medium-length, dark hair that is styled in a way that is commonly associated with males.
- Overall appearance: The clothing and body structure are consistent with a male presentation.

The visual gender assessment confirms the person is male based on observable facial features and overall appearance.

=== VISUAL BATCH 2 ANALYSIS ===
The person continues to display the same masculine characteristics observed in the first batch. The facial features, including the angular jawline and masculine bone structure, remain consistent across all frames. Based on visual evidence, this is clearly a male individual performing in front of the green screen."""
